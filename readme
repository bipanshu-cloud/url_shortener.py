#Introduction to the project
This script is designed to take a long URL input from the user and convert it into a shortened URL using the TinyURL service. 
URL shortening is a technique on the internet in which a long URL can be made substantially shorter and still direct users to the desired page. 
This is particularly useful for sharing links on social media, emails, or other platforms where character count is limited.
